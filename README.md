# Pandas Express
After defeating the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, our favorite kung fu panda master Po returns to the Valley of Peace to help his father Mr. Ping with his noodle restaurant. Mr. Ping's noodle restaurant hasn't been doing so well, so Po is determined to help his dad figure out what he can do to improve his restaurant. Luckily, Po has been trained in the revered and ancient Python style of Shaolin martial arts and will analyze a dataset from Yelp to save his father's restaurant, like a true Kung Fu Pandas master.

This is a Python tutorial for cleaning and analyzing the Yelp Data Challenge dataset with Pandas and other Python machine learning tools
